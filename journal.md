# Daily progress journal

## 2024-03-19
- Tried to get spispy to work, no dice really.

## 2024-03-20
- Modified Pi Pico board to run at 1v8, tested serprog and flashrom (working)
- Gave up with spispy as pi pico r/w cycle speed is good enough (~1m)

## 2024-03-21
- Got CPLD and BIOS update (CN22) header cable (1.27mm 2x6 flat), soldered on
ext board. Tested readout through CN22 (working)
- Started playing around with coreboot builds

## 2024-03-22
- Installed UART cable, kept on testing coreboot builds (not much luck)
- Extracted coreboot .config file from coreboot image given by lib-micro
authors, build works with video out. :)

## 2024-03-23
- Wasted half a day trying to get red unlock to work with my coreboot
- Discovered at my own expense that until you power flush the board, the intel
CSME will keep run the last firmware, even if you flash a new one.
POWER FLUSH THE BOARD!
- Started to thinker with coreboot to get fast boot times

## 2024-03-24
- Why is the thing discovered yesterday happening? Maybe it can be useful to
achieve faster boot times:
	flash red unlocked ME -> slow boot -> check success with `rdmsr 0x1e6`
	flash non-red unlocked ME -> boot quickly as long as we can read 0x1e6
- Reading exploit details to understand the above

## 2024-03-25
- Build coreboot payload to do `mul`s in a loop, similar to plundervolt PoC
- Turns out, there is no traffic on the PMBus when it's crunching numbers.
No need to touch the PMC firmware! :)

## 2024-03-26
< Day off >

## 2024-03-27
- Wasted one full day on exception handling on x86 (I am mentally challenged)
to perform MSR detection. If magic MSR is readable, the CPU is red unlocked and
we don't need to install the slow ME firmware. If not, load red unlocked ME.

## 2024-03-28
- Got General Protection Fault handler to work, found the right part of the
codebase to insert the MSR check. Now to test it.

## 2024-03-29
- Find out how to modify coreboot build system to include both ME firmwares.

## 2024-03-30
< Day off >

## 2024-03-31
- Found out that with the stock BIOS the GPIO header works out of the box
(tested the UART in ubuntu). It does not work in linux with coreboot or
slimbootloader. How is the original BIOS setting the GPIOs?
- Actually, coreboot can output on the GPIOs! How to init it in my payload?

## 2024-04-01
- Turns out that actually GPIOs don't work in coreboot, I only forgot to power
cycle the board and thus the FPGA still had the bitstream from the original
BIOS.

## 2024-04-02
< Day off >

## 2024-04-03
- Temporarily ignore GPIO/UART thing, focus on ME firmware
- Use coreboot FSP_2 setting, expand it to apollolake architecture

## 2024-04-04
- Turns out the FSP is always loaded by the CPU before my code is even executed
No way to change the ME firmware from coreboot. :(
- Maybe this is good: I can always use the red unlocked ME firmware, as it will
stall only later and move my payload to coreboot's romstage

## 2024-04-05
< Day off >

## 2024-04-06
- Verified that the msr is readable in early bootstage

## 2024-04-07
- Read up about CustomProcessingUnit/lib-micro internals

## 2024-04-08
- Trying to merge lib-micro in coreboot

## 2024-04-09
< Day off >

## 2024-04-10
- Trying to integrate lib-micro in coreboot. Fail

## 2024-04-11
- Libmicro working in linux 32bit binary
- Not working in coreboot, it writes URAM, but can't invoke arb. ucode

## 2024-04-12
< Day off >

## 2024-04-13
< Day off >

## 2024-04-14
< Day off >

## 2024-04-15
- Managed to run libmicro in coreboot in chip.c `platform_fsp_notify_status`:
`phase == READY_TO_BOOT`. This takes ~10s to run, but it works!

## 2024-04-16
- Managed to run libmicro in coreboot at the end of `soc_init` in ramstage: ~1s

## 2024-04-17
- Apparently `set_power_limits` must be called before any ucode injection
is done. Idk why, as it seems to be doing only power-related stuff
- I could (not tried) move my code to early bootblock, but that requires doing
something with `BIOS_RESET_CPL`, idk...
- Code cleanup
- Add some pi pico sync stuff around the hijacked opcode

## 2024-04-21
- Pi pico firmware sync stuff

## 2024-04-22
- Got the sync to work properly (issues with UART not being ready to be read
when the ISR was called)
- Tested the setup without actual fault injection, seems ok.
- It seems that the Intel CPU is running at a rather low ~16MHz. I measured the
time between two consecutive `R` sent by the target with the logic analyzer,
and they were 579,96273 ms apart. According to binja, 9 instructions are
executed per cycle, and there are 1000000 cycles. That means:
$$\left(\frac{579,96273 \ \text{ms}}{1000000 * 9}\right)^{âˆ’1} \approx 15,5 \ \text{Hz}$$

## 2024-06-05
- Writing code to retreive delay loop duration on target from pi pico

## 2024-06-06
- Writing code to calculate target UART TX -> pico UART RX delay
- Done obtaining relevant delays, I guess

## 2024-06-13
- Writing code to identify stable threshold voltages
- Switched power supply to lab psu for easy target reset

## 2024-06-14
- Reliable code
- Found some weird behavior with target dying after a while (see images in
notebooks/img)
- Above looks similar to when I power the target on and it is simply not
brought up entirely, that is without any fault injection going on. It just
boots, does its thing for a couple of ms, then hangs. Probs it does not like
the ME being only half loaded or something.

## 2024-06-15
- Moved glitch success detection to target side, as it is faster (and easier to
find the right moment to glitch)
- Added Vp preparation voltage config

## 2024-06-17
- Some more testing

## 2024-06-18
- Looked up alternative boards for Plundervolt/Voltpillager

## 2024-06-23
- I see something interesting, sometimes the loop duration is shorter. Is the
voltpillager-like loop with a lot of jumps a problem? Am I breaking the jump or
the muls?
- Unrolled the loop, it seems that loops are getting shorter but I always get
`R` instead of `S` as I would expect when a mul is actually glitched (?)

## 2024-06-24
- Found some partial success? The board reports two different results for the
muls, but it hangs after the first byte is sent. Try adding delays?

## 2024-06-25
- Added delay after the mul loop is done to allow the voltage to be restored
after the glitch and before the UART peripheral is used. Maybe the CPU is
browning out due to that beign turned on?
- Expanded search space and just left the glitching running for a while:
SUCCESS!

## 2024-06-27
- Improved python code for readabilty
- Wrote headless code for data collection
- It seems that both `imul 0x80000, 0x4` and `imul 0x4, 0x80000` can be
glitched, but Plundervolt's paper mentions they never had success with the
latter. Weird?

## 2024-06-28
- Seems like on my CPU, FIT installs the updated ucode on all cores. On some
other CPUs, it only installs it on the BSP (Boot Strap Processor). This might
be interesting for software-based attacks on those CPUs (?)

## 2024-06-29
- Alvise probably found the reason for half success: at that stage coreboot has
not fully populated the IDT, thus when an exception is thrown it just hangs.
Probably when I get a half success the CPU is just in some weird state that
will eventually throw an exception down the line due to some corrupt stack
write or something.
- Well, it turns out that if I run on the target code that only relies on
registers instead of stack, I don't get *any* glitch. (:
I suppose I was glitching some memory access before? Not muls.

## 2024-06-30
- Collecting data points for stackless code. Some weak half success somewhere
with small width, idk.
- Improved db plotter with separate plots for different aspects (one set for
each voltage...)
- Improved python control code to check if settings can actually be achieved
by PMIC (due to low slew rate). It prints/raise exceptions if settings are not
feasible.

## 2024-07-01
- Tested wider Vp and Vf ranges with stackless code, no success. I estimated
Vp setting Vf to 1.24V (nominal VCore), and lowering Vp alone. The target is
stable up to VID 35, below that I get glitches. I then used Vp in the range
[30:35] and Vf in the range [1.24:1.28] and got no glitches. I then used Vp in
[20:35], but no dice.
- Started to read into Intel Firmware Support Package (FSP) to validate which
caches are available and used as RAM.
	- Verified this CPU uses FSP v2.0.
		Source: Apollolake Intel(R) Firmware Support Package (FSP) Integration Guide $ 3
		Source: coreboot/src/soc/intel/apollolake/Kconfig - PLATFORM_USES_FSP_2_0
	- romstage boots from
		- src/cpu/x86/entry32.S
		- src/soc/intel/common/block/cpu/car/cache_as_ram.S
	- In cache_as_ram.S, it configures CAR to use L2 cache as RAM because it
	checks the cache ram size, and it is defined to be 768 KB in
	src/soc/intel/apollolake/Kconfig
	L1d cache is 24KB, L1i cache is 32KB, L2 cache is 2 MB (source: Intel Atom
	Processor C3000 Product Family Datasheet), so the only cache that can be
	in use as RAM is the L2 cache.

## 2024-07-02
- CAR area is configured as Write Back (WB) cacheable and non evictable
	- src/soc/intel/common/block/cpu/car/cache_as_ram.S
- INTEL_CAR_CQOS is enabled, which enables Cache Quality of Service (CQoS) to
"allows more fine-grained control of cache usage. As result, it is possible to
set up a portion of L2 cache for CAR and use the remainder for actual caching."
Source: Coreboot kconfig option description
	- CQOS mode also disables L1 and L2 prefetchers on line 376
	- OR DOES IT? It is then enabled again at 440
- After CAR is enabled, it jumps to `car_init_done` and finally
`bootblock_c_entry`.

## 2024-07-03
- Load-heavy target code can be *very* easily glitched, but the results I get
over UART are weird. I get >0 successful glitches, but the faulted values
are either 0xAAAAAAAA (the standard value) or 0x00000000 (initialization
value).
	- Actually sometimes I have 0xAAAAAA00/0xAAAA0000, which is interesting
	but max 0.3% of the times.
	- Good parameters are
```bash
python3 data_collector.py glitch2.db <table name> load --ext-offset 90 150 1 --prep-voltage 36 36 1 --width 10 30 1 --voltage 35 35 1
```
- VCC controls VCore and also L1/L2 cache voltage (they are part of the core)

by 5 intel people

## 2024-07-04
- Verified that old mul target is also glitchable with the same parameters I
have found for the load target. Target code just did not run for long enough,
so the voltage was still low at the end of the loop, and the CPU died. I
increased the loop duration and got glitches there as well, this means that
all my tests are consistent.

## 2024-07-05
- Started to play around with ucode patching + studied uopcode "documentation"

## 2024-07-06
- Patched `rdrand` to perform (`ecx += eax != ebx`):
	```
	tmp0 = eax - ebx
	if (tmp0 == 0) ecx += 1
	```
Works in both 64 and 32 bit code with libmicro on linux
- Added this code in coreboot, target CPU hangs after "some" short amount of
time

## 2024-07-07
- Determined that the CPU hangs only when I have a conditional jump in ucode
- Tried to make conditional seqwords work. No luck (maybe I am stupid)
- Changed ucode to perform (`ecx += eax - ebx`):
	```
	tmp0 = eax - ebx
	ecx += tmp0
	```
- Found glitces in ucode! :D
Params:
```bash
python3 data_collector.py glitch2.db _6a234f1_customucode cmp --ext-offset 90 150 1 --prep-voltage 34 36 1 --width 1 30 1 --voltage 32 34 1
```
